<h1>Movies Slick Walrus Enjoyed</h1>
<h2>In no particular order</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Princess Bride</h3>
<p>I have seen this movie more than any other movie ever made. I love the action, comedy, and romance. It's a completely 100% feel good movie</p>
<h3>Serenity</h3>
<p>You'll get more out of this if you've seen the Firefly TV series, but the character development alone is worth the watch. It doesn't hurt that The Operative is one of the best villains ever portrayed in media</p>
<h3>The Rock</h3>
<p>A movie I have seen so many times and will always watch it again if I happen to see that it is playing on a cable station. Fun dumb action and a other sympathetic villain.</p>
